    "<b>1.</b> In the .NET Framework, there is a special component of the <b>CLR</b> that looks after memory management. It is called a <b>\"garbage collector\"</b> (automated memory cleaning system). The garbage collector has the following main tasks: to check when the allocated memory for variables is no longer in use, to release it and make it available for allocation of new objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2.</b> It is important to note that it is not exactly clear at what moment the memory gets cleaned of unused objects (local variables for example). According to the C# language specifications, it happens at some moment after a given variable gets out of scope but it is not specified, whether this happens instantly, after some time or when the available memory becomes insufficient for the normal program operation.\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>5.</b> The idea for independence from the environment has been set in the earliest stages of creation of the .NET platform and is implemented with the help of a little trick. The output code is not compiled to instructions for a specific microprocessor and does not use the features of a specific operating system; it is compiled to the so called <b>Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL).</b> This <b>MSIL</b> is not directly executed by the microprocessor but <b>from a virtual environment</b> called <b>Common Language Runtime (CLR)</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>6.</b> <b>Common Language Runtime (CLR) – is the Heart of .NET !</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>7.</b> CLR is an abstract computing machine (virtual machine). Similarly to physical computers, it supports a set of instructions, registries, memory access and input-output operations. CLR ensures a controlled execution of the .NET programs using the full capabilities of the processor and the operating system. CLR also carries out the managed access to the memory and the other resources of the computer, while adhering to the access rules set when the program is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>8.</b> The .NET platform contains the C# language, CLR and many auxiliary instruments and libraries ready for use.\n",

    "<b>9.</b> There are a few versions of .NET according to the targeted user group:\n",
    "   1. .NET Framework is the most common version of the .NET environment because of its general purpose. It is used in the development of console applications, Windows applications with a graphical user interface, web applications and many more.\n",
    "   2. .NET Compact Framework (CF) is a \"light\" version of the standard .NET Framework and is used in the development of applications for mobile phones and other PDA devices using Windows Mobile Edition.\n",
    "   3. Silverlight is also a \"light\" version of the .NET Framework, intended to be executed on web browsers in order to implement multimedia and Rich Internet Applications.\n",
    "   4. .NET for Windows Store apps is a subset of .NET Framework designed for development and execution of .NET applications in Windows 8 and Windows RT environment (the so called Windows Store Apps).\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>10.</b> The contemporary programmer uses libraries and components every day, and saves a lot of effort by doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>11.</b> A .NET technology is the collection of .NET classes, libraries, tools, standards and other programming means and established development models, which determine the technological framework for creating a certain type of application.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>12.</b> Each .NET library or technology is utilized by creating objects and calling their methods. The set of public classes and methods in the programming libraries is called <b>Application Programming Interface (API)</b> or just <b>API</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>13.</b> As an example we can look at the .NET API itself; it is a set of .NET class libraries, expanding the capabilities of the language and adding high-level functionality. All .NET technologies offer a public API. The technologies are often referred to simply as API, which adds certain functionality. For example: API for working with files, API for working with charts, API for working with printers, API for reading and creating Word and Excel documents, API for creating PDF documents, Web development API, etc.\n",

    "#### Naming Variables - Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "* The name of the variable can be any of our choice but must follow certain rules defined in the C# language specification:\n",
    "1. Variable names can contain the letters a-z, A-Z, the digits 0-9 as well as the character '_'.\n",
    "2. Variable names cannot start with a digit.\n",
    "3. Variable names cannot coincide with a keyword of the C# language. For example, base, char, default, int, object, this, null and many others cannot be used as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming Variables - Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The names should be descriptive and explain what the variable is used for. For example, an appropriate name for a variable storing a person’s name is personName and inappropriate name is a37.\n",
    "2. Only Latin characters should be used. Although Cyrillic is allowed by the compiler, it is not a good practice to use it in variable names or in the rest of the identifiers within the program.\n",
    "3. In C# it is generally accepted that variable names should start with a small letter and include small letters, every new word, however, starts with a capital letter. For instance, the name firstName is correct and better to use than firstname or first_name. Usage of the character _ in the variable names is considered a bad naming style.\n",
    "4. Variable names should be neither too long nor too short – they just need to clarify the purpose of the variable within its context.\n",
    "5. Uppercase and lowercase letters should be used carefully as C# distinguishes them. For instance, age and Age are different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Always try to use short and precise names when naming the variables. Follow the rule that the variable name should state what it is used for, e.g. the name should answer the question \"what value is stored in this variable\". When this condition is not fulfilled then try to find a better name. Digits are not appropriate to be used in variable names.</b>"

    "### Conversion to String\n",
    "<b>Info:</b>\n",
    "1. If it is necessary we can convert any type of data, including the value <b>null</b>, to string.\n",
    "2. The conversion of strings is done automatically whenever you use the concatenation operator (<b>+</b>) and one of the arguments is not of type string. In this case the argument is <b>converted to a string</b> and the operator returns a new string representing the concatenation of the two strings.\n",
    "3. Another way to convert different objects to type string is to call the method <b>ToString()</b> of the variable or the value. <b>It is valid for all data types in .NET Framework.</b>\n",
    "4. Even calling <b>3.ToString()</b> is fully valid in C# and the result will return the string <b>\"3\"</b>.\n",
    "5. Note that the <b>\"+\"</b> for concatenating strings can cause <b>unpleasant effects</b> on the addition of numbers, because it has equal priority with the operator <b>\"+\"</b> for mathematical addition.\n",
    "6. <b>Unless the priorities of the operations are changed by placing the brackets, they will always be executed from left to right.</b>"
