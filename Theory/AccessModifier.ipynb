    "<b>Info 1:</b> \n",
    "1. If a method is declared without an access modifier (either public or private), it is accessible from all classes in the current assembly, but not accessible for any other assemblies (let say from other projects in Visual Studio).\n",
    "2. In method declaration there cannot be more than one access modifier.\n",
    "3. When a method has a keyword static, in its declaration, this method is called static.\n",
    "4. <b>To call a static method</b> there is <b>no need to have an instance of a class in which the static method is declared.</b>\n",
    "5. Method can NOT be declared inside the body of another method.\n",
    "6. A method can be invoked from its own body. Such a call is referred to as recursion. \n",
    "7. When a method is declare, any of the elements from the parameters list are called parameters (formal parameters).\n",
    "8. When we call a method the values we use to assign to its parameters are named as arguments.\n",
    "9. PARAMETERS vs ARGUMENTS\n",
    "10. By passing the argument that are of reference type, the only thing that is copied is the variable that keeps the reference to the object, but not the object data.\n",
    "11. <b>Primitive types are passed by their values, the objects, however, are passed by reference.</b>\n",
    "12. A good programming practice is, when we declare fields in the class, to explicitly initialize them with some default value, even if the default value is zero. This will make our code clearer and easy to read.\n",
    "13. Something more, when we compile the code, the places where const fields are referred are replaced with theirs particular values directly without to use the constant variable at all. For this reason the const fields are called <b>compile-time constants</b>, because they are replaced with the value during the compilation process.\n",
    "14. Fields, declared as readonly, allow one-time initialization either in the moment of the declaration or in the class constructors. Later theirs values cannot be changed. Because of this reason, the readonly fields are called run-time constants – constants, because their values cannot be changed after assignment and run-time, because this process happens during the execution of the program (in runtime).\n",
    "15. The access to the non-static elements of a class (fields and methods) is done via the reserved word <b>this</b> and the operator for acees - <b>\"dot\"</b>.\n",
    "16. When it is not required explicitly the reserved word this can be skipped when we access the elements of the class. For better readability use this keyword even when not required.\n",
    "17. We should know, when we assign access modifier to a filed, one in most of the cases has to be private, because this ensures the highest level of security applied to the field.\n",
    "18. In (C#) it is not allowed to declare a method whose name matches the name of the class."

    "<b>Info 2 - Constructors:</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "1. As we already know, the constructors are similar to methods, but they do not have a return type (therefore we called them pseudo-methods).\n",
    "2. In C# it is mandatory that the name of every constructor matches the name of the class in which it resides.\n",
    "3. Creating constructors with different signatures is called constructor overloading.\n",
    "4. When we do not declare any constructor in a given class, the compiler will create one, known as a default implicit constructor.\n",
    "5. If we declare at least one constructor in a given class, the compiler will not create a default constructor for us.\n",
    "6. Although the default constructor and the one without parameters are similar in signature, they are completely different.\n",
    "7. The difference is that the default implicit constructor is created by the compiler, if we do not declare any constructor in our class, and the constructor without parameters is declared by us.\n",
    "8. Moreover, as explained earlier, the default constructor will always have access level protected or public, depending on the access modifier of the class, while the level of access of the constructor without parameters all depends on us – we define it."

    "2. In practice <b>the behavior of the method does not depend of the object state</b> (the values in the object field).\n",
    "3. A static member of the class is every field, property, method or other member, which has a static modifier in its declaration. That means that fields, methods and properties, marked as static, belong to the particular class rather than to any particular object of the given class.\n",
    "4. Therefore, when we mark a field, method or property as static, we can use them without creating any object of the given class.\n",
    "5. <b>Static elements of the class can be used without creating an object of the given class.</b>\n",
    "6. Sometimes, however, we want to have <b>common fields</b> for all objects of a given class. To achieve that, we have to use the static modifier in the field declarations. As we already said, such fields are called <b>static fields</b>. In the literature they are also called <b>class variables</b>.\n",
    "7. All objects, created by the description of a given class (that is, instances of a given class), share the static fields of the class.\n",
    "8. The static variables are shared between all objects of the class and do not belong to any object of the particular class.\n"
